# Full Stack Project - Pet Adoption Platform

The backend portion of a pet adoption application will be responsible for providing all the data the frontend requires. All inputs received from the user should be validated. Keep your folder structures clean and scalable. Below is a list of API’s that will need to be implemented for this application.

You can start your application by simply adding routes and functionality, or you can structure your application first (using an MVC approach or any other), or feel free to do a mashup of these options. 

Notes:
-	Make sure to protect any routes that need to be protected. 
-	Validate any incoming user input. Handle any errors.
-	You are welcome to use any external libraries of your choosing. 
-	The route names are suggestions, feel free to call them whatever makes most sense to you.
-	The implementation details are up to you, if you would like to use JWT for authentication, feel free to do so, whatever method you prefer.
